# MCP-gis

A comprehensive framework for analyzing productivity agglomeration effects across industries in Tokyo, with special focus on AI implementation impacts.

## Overview

This project analyzes how geographic concentration of economic activities affects productivity across different industries in Tokyo. We examine agglomeration effects, spatial patterns, and the role of artificial intelligence adoption in enhancing productivity benefits.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection**: Multi-source integration from Tokyo Statistical Yearbook, METI statistics, and Economic Census
- **Agglomeration Analysis**: Concentration indices, spatial autocorrelation, market potential calculations
- **AI Impact Assessment**: Technology adoption effects on productivity across industries
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Maps, charts, and dashboards for Tokyo productivity patterns

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Tatsuru-Kikuchi/MCP-gis.git
cd MCP-gis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run analysis
python main_analysis.py
```

## Research Questions

1. Which industries in Tokyo benefit most from agglomeration effects?
2. How does AI adoption vary across industries and impact productivity?
3. What are the optimal spatial strategies for economic development?
4. How can policy support both agglomeration benefits and AI diffusion?
